# How to contribute

I stopped playing Regnum a few days after creating the initial version of this map, so a lot of community help is needed to keep it up.

For now, if you have no idea what you're doing, only add new data. Don't add new Layer Groups or something. I will extend it a bit in the future, so you can edit the data sources in Excel or something like that.

If you have any ideas, feel free to open an issue on github so we can discuss. There's a lot of stuff that can be done with the project domain :)
